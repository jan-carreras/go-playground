package horses

/**
There are twenty-five horses. At most, five horses can race together at a
time. You must determine the fastest, second fastest, and third fastest
horses. Find the minimum number of races in which this can be done
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What tools do I have to solve this?!!!!
It seems like an equation, but it's unclear to me :/

My approach has lead us to do 11 races, on each race eliminating 2 horses.

After seeing that the solution is 7, I did not know how to advance (should I tried to
think more about the problem?).

Then, when I've understood that classifying the 1st horst (race on top winning horses) could discard
two entire groups, the solution came naturally.

I've needed to watch the solution
