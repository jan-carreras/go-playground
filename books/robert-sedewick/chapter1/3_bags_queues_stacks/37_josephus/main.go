// Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire
// straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They
// arrange themselves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and
// proceed around the circle, eliminating every Mth person until only one person
// is left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being
// eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that takes N and M from the command
// line and prints out the order in which people are eliminated (and thus would
// show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
//
// Input: java Josephus 7 2
//        1 3 5 0 4 2 6

// Josephus returns the order into which the people is going to die. The last one
// in the list gets saved.
