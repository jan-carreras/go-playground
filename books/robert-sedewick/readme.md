Solutions for Robert Sedewick's book Algorithms
===============================================

## Description

My solutions to the book's proposed coding exercises.

## Copyright

The definitions of the problems sometimes appear with the
solution's files, like:

```go
//  1.1.22 Write a version of BinarySearch that uses the recursive rank() given on
//  page 25 and traces the method calls. Each time the recursive method is called,
//  print the argument values lo and hi, indented by the depth of the recursion.
//  Hint: Add an argument to the recursive method that keeps track of the depth.
```
